**30/11/2022 - Ibrahim's Notes:**
- ~~TensorFlow~~ PyTorch
- CNN vs. RNN: RNN might be better due to our sequential data
- Each frame is part of a video. Analysis shouldn't be done only "locally and independently"  
- Consider existing approaches for emotion detection from a video, perhaps on humans or other animals, and "translate" it for horses  
- Data preperation stage: cropping and alignment
